- Computation is evaluation of functions
- Functions are data
- Higher order functions
    - functions that take in other functions
- Avoid mutable state
    - constantly creating new values, not updating old vars
    - "not mutating, we're transforming"
- Recursion
    - can't "update" a counter hence we use recursion
- Lazy evaluation
    - delaying computation until necessary
